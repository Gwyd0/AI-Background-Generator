# AI-Background-Generator
This is an idea I had a while ago.
My theory is that with enough "fine-tuning" someone could generate their perfect desktop background.

Currently, this program can generate three types of desktops
* City Landscapes - my personal favourite
* Close up Nature shots
* Cursed Anime backgrounds
* and custom prompts.

Each type can be cropped into 
* portrait
* landscape

Although as OpenAI's DALL-E only allows up to 1024x1024 per image the quality is not always the best.
# Examples
These are cherry-picked, so don't expect every single one to be this good.

# How to run

for starters you need an openai api key(its free to make an account and get one with limited uses).
