# AI-Background-Generator
This is an idea i had a while ago.
My theory is that with enough "fine tuning" someone could generate their perfect desktop background.

Currently this program can generate three types of desktops
* City Landscapes - my personal faverote
* Close up Nature shots
* Cursed aimie backgrounds
* and custom prompts.

Each type can be cropped into 
* portaite 
* landscape

Allthough as openais dall-e only allows up to 1024x1024 per image the qauiluty isnt the best.
# Examples 
## City Landscapes


# How to run

for starters you need an openai api key(its free to make an account and get one with limited uses).
